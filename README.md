# Najaty: AI-Powered Seizure Monitoring and Prediction App

Najaty is a mobile application designed to monitor and predict epileptic seizures using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This project is aimed at improving the quality of life for epilepsy patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by providing a proactive solution for seizure monitoring and early prediction.

Project Overview
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurring seizures, affecting millions of people worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, patients with epilepsy face significant challenges, including long wait times for hospital monitoring, lack of seizure prediction tools, and the unpredictability of seizures. These challenges impact not only the patients' safety and independence but also the well-being of their caregivers.

Najaty aims to address these challenges by offering a real-time, accessible solution through a mobile app. Using the sensors in smartphones and wearable devices like Apple Watches, the app will continuously monitor patients and provide timely alerts to prevent dangerous situations before a seizure occurs.

Features
#Seizure Monitoring: Najaty continuously monitors the user’s seizure activity using data from smartphone sensors and wearable devices.
#Seizure Prediction: Using AI and ML, the app attempts to predict seizures before they happen, providing users and caregivers with advance warnings.
#Real-Time Alerts: When a seizure is predicted or detected, alerts are sent to the patient, caregivers, or emergency services.
#Data-Driven Insights: Najaty tracks seizure patterns over time, offering valuable data to patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals for improved treatment strategies.
#Saudi Arabia Focus: The app specifically addresses the unique challenges faced by epilepsy patients in Saudi Arabia, where current epilepsy care options such as EMUs are underutilized and waiting times are long.

Problem Statement
In Saudi Arabia, epilepsy monitoring is primarily conducted in hospital-based Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMUs) for 3-5 days. However, there is a significant gap in care due to the long waiting times and limited access to these facilities. Additionally, no widely available tool currently exists to predict seizures before they occur, leaving patients at risk of accidents and prolonged unconsciousness without timely intervention.

Objectives
Najaty’s goal is to:
#Provide a portable, AI-driven solution to monitor and predict seizures.
#Empower patients and caregivers with timely alerts and predictive insights.
#Improve access to proactive epilepsy care in Saudi Arabia, reducing dependency on EMUs and long wait times.
#Ensure compliance with health regulations and prioritize data privacy and security.
